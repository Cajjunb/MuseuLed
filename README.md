# PCB Circuit Specification

## Description
The PCB Circuit Specification project aims to provide detailed specifications and guidelines for designing printed circuit boards (PCBs). This project covers various aspects of PCB design, including component placement, trace routing, and manufacturing considerations. The project is for a Computer Vision application and for the #ART15 fair of computer art.

## Features
- Comprehensive guidelines for PCB component placement
- Detailed trace routing specifications
- Design rules for ensuring signal integrity and minimizing noise
- Manufacturing considerations and best practices
- Sample PCB designs and case studies for reference

## Requirements
- PCB design software (e.g., Eagle, Altium Designer)
- Understanding of electronic components and circuit design principles
- Knowledge of PCB manufacturing processes
